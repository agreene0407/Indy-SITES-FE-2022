Let's create a class website! We'll need a homepage to introduce the class and sections for each class member that we can link to.

Our homepage should include:
- What the class is
- What we will accomplish
- Who is in the class

Individual Sections should include:
- A brief bio of the indivdual whose section it is. 
  (Think elevator pitch - Who are you?, where are you from?, what do you like to do? Why you're in the FE course? What personal goals do you have?)
- A summary of their coding experience
  (Feel free to say you're a student and mention any school projects you may have done. At a minimum, you can include this!)
- Demonstrations of any work they've completed through the year 
  (more on this later)
  
  
  Once we have our sections we will work as a team to put them together, and later we'll develop a stylesheet for the site!
